NOTES:

- [ ] Map marking system works but isn't at the correct stage
    - [ ] Better redux -> Smoother transition and update the value in the input to the name
    - [ ] Work out the best way to handle all this, since redux will work for this, maybe not
            when more details will be required??
- [ ] Initial location should be handled better
